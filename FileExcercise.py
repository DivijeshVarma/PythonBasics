# about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt
# in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file and
# prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire file,
# once by looping over the file object, and once by storing the lines in a list and then working
# with them outside the with block.
