# Testing Multiple Conditions The if- elif- else chain is powerful,
# but itâ€™s only appropriate to use when you just need one test to pass.
# As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it skips the rest of the tests.
# This code would not work properly if we used an if- elif- else block,
# because the code would stop running after only one test passes.
